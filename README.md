# buffercraft.kak

Buffercraft is a plugin for the [kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune)
text editor which tries to emulate some behavior of
[`tpope/vim-projectionist`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist).

It's a work-in-progress. Check back later to see docs about usage, installation,
and configuration.
